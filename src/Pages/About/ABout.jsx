        Bloodsavers acknowledges and pays our deepest respect to the past,
        present, and future Traditional Custodians and Elders of this nation. We
        recognize the enduring connection that Indigenous peoples have with the
        land and honor their custodianship over generations. We acknowledge the
        importance of preserving and celebrating their rich cultural, spiritual,
        and educational practices.
